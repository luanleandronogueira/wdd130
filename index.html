      <p>
        I am married with Aylla, and we have a little girl called Elisa!! My
        fascination with technology came to life during my customer support
        role, a pivotal experience that ignited my journey into the tech realm.
        Starting with HTML and CSS, I delved deeper into programming
        languages like PHP and C#. Crafting websites and witnessing client
        satisfaction, I realized technology isn't just a careerâ€”it's a means to
        positively impact lives. I am convinced that technology holds the
        power to simplify the world and make life more accessible. Hence, I am
        fully committed to refining my skills and exploring new opportunities in
        the vast tech landscape.  Beyond my professional commitment, I
        dedicate part of my time voluntarily to causes I believe in, enhancing
        teamwork and leadership skills. These diverse experiences haven't just
        shaped my trajectory but have also enriched my perspective as a
        developer. Eager to continue pursuing my passion, contributing to a more
        connected and technologically advanced world.
